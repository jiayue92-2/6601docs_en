-  **Fully Integrated Power Management Circuits**

The chip includes an on-chip DCDC associated with LDOs to provide noise isolated power supplies for digital and analog modules. The DCDC has a single, wide-range (3.3~5 V) supply input and dual outputs (1.2 V, 1.8 V) to extremely minimize Bill of Material (BoM). Moreover, the chip provides two UART interfaces that can follow the DCDC supply to adjust interface voltage range from 3.3 V to 5V.

-  **Entire Security System**

A completed security infrastructure, including AES/RSA/ECC crypto engine, hash engine and True Random Generator (TRNG), is also integrated. ASR550X can provide a comprehensive security solution as Security Boot flow, Flash Image Protection and dynamic encryption/decryption for customer data.

-  **Entire Software Solution**

ASR550X provides an entire software solution, such as RTOS/TCPIP/SSL/MQTT/Wi-Fi/AT and more. The customer just needs to simply develop applications then go to market.

In pass through application scenario, the customer needs no any code developing in ASR550X, but controls ASR550X with AT command through UART interface. In master-control application scenario, the customer just needs to focus on their own application developing, with the OS/ communication layer/ Security already supported in ASR550X SDK, and easily calling the 550X’s API.

General purpose Input / Output (GPIO) pins are fully configurable. They are multiplexed with other interfaces, such as I2C, SPI, UART and etc. The GPIO pins support the below features:

-  Input mode: the input value can be read through register.
-  Output mode: the output value can be set through register.
-  Interrupt: the input can be set to edge-trigger or level-trigger to generate CPU interrupt. Support 4 types of trigger: Low level, high level, falling edge and rising edge.
-  Internal pull-up or pull-down configurable

2.5.9 TIMER and WatchDog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ASR550X provides 2 independent HW timer (besides, PWM block provides 4 timers, RTC block provides 1 real-time timer and 1 low-power timer). Each Timer integrates 32-bit or 16-bit counter (software configured). Each Timer support the below modes:

-  Free-running mode: it is the default mode, the counter counts from max value (0xFFFF of 16bit mode or 0xFFFFFFFF of 32bit mode) to 0, then continue from max value to 0, when it counts to 0, an interrupt is generated to CPU.
-  Periodic timer mode: the counter counts from software configured value to 0, then continue from the setting value to 0, when it counts to 0, an interrupt is generated to CPU.
-  One-shot timer mode: the counter counts from the software configured value to 0, then stop counting and generate an interrupt to CPU.

The Watch Dog Timer is used to resume the controller operation when it had been disturbed by malfunctions such as noise and system errors. It can generate a general reset or an interrupt request.

2.5.10 CRYPTO ENGINE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
